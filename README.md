 Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project uses **machine learning** to predict the presence of heart disease based on clinical data. The model is built using **Logistic Regression**, a widely used classification algorithm in the medical domain.

Technologies Used

- Python üêç
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn (`sklearn`)

Dataset

The dataset used includes the following clinical features:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type (`cp`)
- Resting blood pressure (`trestbps`)
- Cholesterol (`chol`)
- Fasting blood sugar (`fbs`)
- Resting ECG (`restecg`)
- Maximum heart rate achieved (`thalach`)
- Exercise induced angina (`exang`)
- ST depression (`oldpeak`)
- Slope of peak exercise ST segment (`slope`)
- Number of major vessels (`ca`)
- Thalassemia (`thal`)
